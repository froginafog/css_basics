        <p> To CSS or not to CSS. 
            That is the question. 
            To Python or not to Python.
            That is something I don't know.
            To C or not to C.
            That is something that I can't answer.
            To C++ or not to C++.
            That is a complicated question.
            To HTML or not to HTML.
            That is not a choice.
            To Javascript or not to Javascript.
            That is the myth.
